PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database management system. The original name of PostgreSQL is 
Postgres therefore, sometimes PostgreSQL is referred as Postgres. Many companies who have built products and solutions
used PostgreSQL.

I've used Postgres a lot from my Computer Science 350 class (Applications of Databases).  It is a popular choice for 
many small and large projects and more companies are adopting PostgreSQL. 

To help understand better what is a relation database management system, it is defined as: a type of database management
system (DBMS) that stores data in the form of related tables. It is a key component of many web sites and applications.
They provide a structured way to store, organize, and access information.
