Course: Software Engineering (CPSC 430)

Assignment: UMW Honors Web Application

The Honors Program Web Application was made to be a web application and is a replacement for the current system that
is being used by the Honors Program. The honors students information are currently only
accessible by visiting the physical location of the Honors Program office on the
Fredericksburg Campus of the University of Mary Washington. The project was done 
for a professor at the University of Mary Washington as a final project in our Software Engineering. 

The Web Application must allow students from anywhere with internet access to be
able to view their program check sheet. It shall allow the students who are a part of the
UMW Honors Program to view their progress per semester and see what requirements
they have satisfied. The honors students shall be able to view announcements that are
posted by the Honors Program administrator which allows the administrators to keep in
touch with the students and up to date of any news from the Honors Program.

The administrators for the Honors Web Application shall be able to post
announcements. Both administrators and students must be able to change their
passwords and view the announcements. Administrators must be able to upload a CSV file
for a particular student and it must update the studentâ€™s information. This should
automatically create accounts for new students and update accounts for continuing
students. Administrators must be able to access all of the student information by searching
for them.

The project taught me more about how to work with your group members better. It also taught me
more about Flask in general, the benefits of working with your group members at the same time, 
and that communication is essential when working in groups.

If I could do this project over again, I would have met up with my group members more face to face
at the same time and try to work with them there. It would have saved us a lot of time and 
we could have finished our project early.
