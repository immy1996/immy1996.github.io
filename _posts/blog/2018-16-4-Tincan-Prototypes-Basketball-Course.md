Course: Advanced Web Development (CPSC 448)

Assignment: TinCan Prototypes

This TinCan Prototypes project was a project that we had to work throughout the whole semester in my Advanced Web Development class.

This project we had to do for the whole semester is basically make our own course and let everyone go on our site, go through the course, and modify
the progress report to see how did they do. There were assignments we had to do along the way for the project. We first had to host our site which we used Amazon Web Service. 
Another assignment we had  to do was that we  had to set up and use a Learning Record Store (LRS) to keep 
track of their progress so we would know who the person was, what was their action that they did during the course (attempted, exited etc), and the 
object of it. When an individual user fills out their information (Name & Email) and then starts the course, it will send an LRS statement to
an LRS. For example, it would say "John Doe started the Basketball Course". The main assignment we had to do was making the course. 
For that part, I made a Basketball course, which basically went in depth of how to play basketball and about it in general. I went into details about it in each page,
added GIFS to help the users to 
visualize and understand it better about the topic, and added a short quiz at the end. There was a short assignment of how to add and use Facebook OAuth to the site. So once you log 
in through your Facebook account on my site, it'll automatically take your name and email address from your facebook account and put it directly
in the box before going to my course. The final assignment we had to do was to modify the progress reports and add visual graphs to it. We used
the graphs from chart.js and implemented to the progress reports page.

The languages I used to modify the site was JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

There were lots of things that I learned from this project. I learned how to set up my own LRS and how to host a site through Amazon Web Services. 
It was fun trying to code more in JavaScript which I learned a lot more about it. Using OAuth and implementing to our site was a great experience
because for future web developing jobs I will at least have the knowledge to implement it to the site.

If I had the chance to start over again, there are a couple things I would do. I would first start doing the assignments early. Because it would save
me a lot of time and I would have more time to work on the next assignments. From then, I would be able to finish the site early. The other thing 
I would do was organize and make my site more appealing. If I had the chance again to start on my assignments early and if I finish my assignment early,
I would take the time to make my site look more better and try to make it more captivating.
