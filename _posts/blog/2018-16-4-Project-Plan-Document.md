Throughout my last semester, I've been taking Software Engineering. In this class, we were assigned groups and we had to write three written documents throughout the semester.


One of the documents was the Project Plan Document. This document provides a detailed plan/schedule for our group to follow for the rest of the semester. This type of plan should provide
a description of the system/product (UMW Honors Web Application), clarify the requirements which our group will be focusing and implementing towards the system, and make an estimate of the amount
of time required to complete the project.

Here is a link to see our full Project Plan Document: <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/376557896/Project-Plan-Document-for-Honors-Program-Web-Application">Click here</a>


After working on this Project Plan Document, I learned a lot from it. One thing I learned was that it to estimate how long each requirement will take to be implemented beforehand.
By estimating how long each requirement will take to be implemented beforehand, you'll get an idea of when you should plan of doing each requirement during a certain time period.
Also another thing I learned from it was to plan ahead and follow along with the plan. By not following the along with the plan, it'll delay us from finishing the system.


There are a couple things that I would do differently after working on this assignment. I would put down the requirements in the Project Plan Document and then check with our
client to make sure that we have the right requirements listed. The other thing I would do differently is make the charts and diagrams early so I will know we did the right
charts and diagrams. The last thing I would do differently is after each of our group members work on the sections they are supposed to work on, we would meet up and make sure
we did our parts right and help our members out on their parts if necessary. Once finished with the Project Plan Document, I would show it to our client and let them know that
this is what our plan schedule looks like and we plan to finish a certain requirement by this estimated date.
