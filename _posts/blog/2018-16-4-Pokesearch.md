Course: Applications of Database (CPSC 350)

Assignment: SQL Project

This SQL project was a project I had to do in my Applications of Database class.

The SQL Project relies heavily on a PostgreSQL database. It must showcase our abilities to write database driven web applications. It must contain queries that uses multiple tables (for example, using joins), uses SocketIO,
tables in 3NF, and a few other requirements. In short, the web application must have a theme, a clean bootstrap website, uses SocketIO, and all tables are in 3NF.

I learned a lot of stuff from this project. One of it was how to use and implement SocketIO in my web applications. Another thing I learned was how to join multiple tables together in certain cases in my web applications and
in general. From learning how to join multiple tables together, it helped me to understand how to put tables in 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF. Also I was able to get a stronger idea of which bootstrap template to use for other projects
in the future.

If I had the chance to do it over again, there are some things I would do differently code wise and group wise. Regardless of how well our web app is, I would put more comments in the code so it will be understandable to the
people who has never seen our code. Especially to us who wrote it so if we look at it after a while, it'll help us to refresh our memory of what we wrote. It would be better to organize the code to make it look more neat.
As in talking about my group members, I would meet up more face to face with them and work with them there instead of doing it on your own. By meeting up more face to face, it would have save us a lot of time working on this
project. Another thing I would do differently is set deadlines to my group members to finish their tasks because before we just assigned tasks but never had a deadline of when we finish it. If we did set deadlines,
we could have finished our project early and make it look better.
