        <p>My name is Imran Ahmed. I'm a senior, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration at the Univerisity of Mary Washington.
        I am orginially from Bangladesh, although I was born in Geneva, Switzerland. I can speak three different languages: English, Bangla, and French.</p>
        
        <p>So far throughout my own time and my undergraduate career, I have acquired theses following skills: C++, Java, Bootstrap, PostgresSQL, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS, 
        JavaScript, SocketIO, Python, and Unix.</p>
        
        <p>After living my first three years in Switzerland, I moved to Southern California and lived there for about a year. After living in Southern California for about
        a year, my family and I moved to Fairfax, Virginia and then moved to South Riding, VA. I grew up mostly in South Riding, Virginia as a Bengali-Swiss-American. 
        Growing up in South Riding, VA was tough because with all the moving and not being there close with my relatives who live in Switzerland. The thing I did was 
        just talk with the friends I eventually made and played video games a lot-which I played a lot of video games.</p>
        
        <p>As I grew older, I fell in love with the game of basketball. I was so in love with basketball that I decided to coach 5 years of it (1 year as assistant coach and 
        4 years as head coach). The four years I was a head coach, we made it to the playoffs every year as one of the top teams in the league and won the championships twice.
        For coaching basketball for 5 years, I have earned a total of 250 volunteer hours. I still play basketball since I was in second grade. Plus I'm a huge Boston fan but I'm
        mostly a huge Boston Celtics fan since I started watching basketball when I was in 2nd grade. I love to play my guitar in my free time, stay in shape, watch basketball 
        (especially Boston Celtics basketball) in my free time, and love spending time with my family and relatives.</p>
